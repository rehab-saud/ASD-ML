## Introduction
Machine Learning has become one of the important fields and fastest-growing areas of computer science and technology, it is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Nowadays, machines are capable of learning like humans, and they are designed to perform tasks. Generally, Machine Learning used to understand the structure of data and fit that data into models that can be understood and utilized by people.

The field of ML can be implemented in healthcare to make better decision making about patients diagnoses and providing necessary needs for treatments. It aims to decrease the time needed to detect diseases, minimize physicians and health care professionals efforts in the detection of diseases and reducing progression through early discover. Predictive analysis by using ML algorithms help to predict the disease more correctly through processing a huge medical datasets.
