## Introduction
Machine Learning has become one of the important fields and fastest-growing areas of computer science and technology, it is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Nowadays, machines are capable of learning like humans, and they are designed to perform tasks. Generally, Machine Learning used to understand the structure of data and fit that data into models that can be understood and utilized by people.

The field of ML can be implemented in healthcare to make better decision making about patients diagnoses and providing necessary needs for treatments. It aims to decrease the time needed to detect diseases, minimize physicians and health care professionals efforts in the detection of diseases and reducing progression through early discover. Predictive analysis by using ML algorithms help to predict the disease more correctly through processing a huge medical datasets.

Many diseases became easy to detect and recognize by using ML such as Heart Diseases Diagnosis and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ASD is known as a developmental disorder that affects behavior and communication, this autism can be diagnosed at any age. By using ML we can recognize these behaviors that are related to ASD. Therefore, it contributes to the provision of health services and the necessary needs early for infected toddlers, and early intervention can improve a childâ€™s overall development, improve and enhance communication skills and interact with individuals.
